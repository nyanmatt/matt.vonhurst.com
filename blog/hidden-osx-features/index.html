<p><span class="first">Like</span> many software developers around my age, I've always used Windows.  I've had a MacBook for about 7 months now, purchased against my will(or rather, against my wallet's will).  Once I got accustomed to a new operating system, I started finding things I loved about it.  Stupid things most OSX users already know, but things a lifetime Windows user would never consider.</p>

<p><span class="first">The Spacebar.</span>  In Finder, the spacebar is like a super preview hotkey.  It's like Right Click->Properties but at the slap of a thumb.  Use it on folders, video, audio, pictures, documents, etc.  My next goal is to find a way to tap into that preview feature and add some more functionalitiy.

<p><span class="first">Control + Mousewheel Up/Down.</span>  This hotkey provides a very smooth full-screen zoom.  I hit this a couple times by accident before actually figuring out how to do it.  Hold Control and scroll with your mousewheel or two-fingers on a multi-touch mousepad.

<p><span class="first">Command + Shift + 4</span>  Or Command + $ if you like to simplify.  This gives you a cross-hair to drag and screenshot a portion of your screen.  Screenshots are saved on your desktop.  Thanks <a href="http://www.thomasignatius.net">Thomas Puleo</a> for that tip!

<p><span class="first">I'm</span> going to update this post as often as I find a new feature I didn't know about.  If you've got an interesting feature you've stumbled upon in OSX, send me an e-mail (mathyu (at) gmail (dot) com) and I'll post it up!</p>
